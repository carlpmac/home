Can OSSEC include information on who changed a file in the alert?

In short, no. OSSEC does not track this information. You could use your OSâ€™s auditing facilities to track this information, and create a rule to alert when an appropriate log is created.

damn

<syscheck>
  <alert_new_files>yes</alert_new_files>

<directories check_all="yes">/etc,/usr/bin,/usr/sbin</directories>
report_changes="yes"

<directories report_changes="yes" realtime="yes" restrict=".php|.js|.py|.sh|.html" check_all="yes">/home/sammy,/var/www</directories>



<rules>
   <include>wordpress_rules.xml</include>
