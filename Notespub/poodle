Executive Summary:

SSL 3.0 protocol is obsolete and insecure yet still widely used for compatibility despite being some 18 yrs old. The POODLE vulnerability specifically describes a man in the middle attack.

Disabling SSL 3.0 on either client or server will suffice to secure against the attack. However, for legacy systems that rely on it there exists no solution.
